            I'm a passionate software developer interested in pursuing
            opportunities in the US. I have been coding for over 6 years, with
            2+ years of professional experience within the financial and oil and
            gas industries. I have experience working in both front-end and
            back-end technologies, though I have a preference for backend work.
